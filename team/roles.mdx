## Default presets

| Preset | Capabilities |
|--------|--------------|
| **Org Admin** | Full control: policies, boards, users, groups, integrations, reminders |
| **Editor** | Create/edit policies and boards; see analytics; no billing/integrations |
| **Employee** | See assigned boards; complete training; sign acknowledgments; use Ask |
| **Legal Professional (Studio)** | Create/manage templates in separate workspace |

## Granular permissions

Permissions are granular (e.g. view policies, edit policies, view analytics, send reminders, view team compliance, manage users, manage integrations).

## Custom presets

Admins can create custom presets (e.g. "Manager": read policies + team analytics + send reminders) by combining permissions. Assign users one or more presets.
