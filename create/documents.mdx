## Document sources

A policy can have **multiple documents**. Each document has a source type:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DocsOrb storage | Created in DocsOrb or uploaded |
| Google Drive | Linked from GDrive |
| SharePoint | Linked from SharePoint |
| OneDrive | Linked from OneDrive |
| Notion | Linked from Notion |
| Confluence | Linked from Confluence |
| URL | Public URL (fetched and ingested) |

## Add documents

### Create in DocsOrb

Rich text editor (Tiptap). Optional AI assist to draft sections. Stored as `docsorb_storage`.

### File upload

PDF, DOCX, Markdown, TXT. OCR for scanned PDFs. Each file = one document.

### Link from integration

Connect storage → pick files → DocsOrb imports. Optional `auto_sync` to re-import when source changes.

### Public URL

Enter a public URL (PDF, HTML). DocsOrb fetches and ingests content.

## Auto-sync

When enabled, DocsOrb re-imports linked documents on change and regenerates training artefacts (overview, key points). Version may bump.
