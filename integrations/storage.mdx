## Supported sources

| Integration | Source type |
|-------------|-------------|
| Google Drive | `gdrive` |
| Microsoft SharePoint | `sharepoint` |
| Microsoft OneDrive | `onedrive` |
| Notion | `notion` |
| Confluence | `confluence` |

## Setup

1. Org Admin connects integration (OAuth or API key)
2. Storage provider stored in `storage_providers`
3. When adding a policy document: file picker lists authorised folders/files
4. On selection: DocsOrb fetches content, stores reference, optionally auto-syncs

## Auto-sync

When enabled, DocsOrb re-imports when source changes and regenerates training artefacts.
