## When acknowledgment is required

If a policy has `ack_required = true`, employees must sign to acknowledge they've read it. A banner shows the deadline from the active campaign.

## Signing flow

1. Employee clicks to sign
2. Signature modal opens
3. Employee types full name as e-signature
4. System logs: user, policy id + version, timestamp
5. Status moves to **Acknowledged**

## Cadence options

| Cadence | When employee signs |
|---------|---------------------|
| Once | Sign once; done |
| Yearly | Annual re-acknowledgment |
| Monthly | Monthly re-acknowledgment |
| Custom | Configurable schedule |

## Acknowledgment campaigns

Campaigns manage batches of acknowledgment requests:

- Status: Draft → Active → Completed → Archived
- Each campaign targets a policy version and audience
- Individual status: Pending / Acknowledged / Expired
